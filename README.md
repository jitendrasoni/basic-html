# basics
Basic of all headless and mordern architecture
There are so man mordern frameworks for the front end technologies but the basic is always the same, in this project I wanted to make sure to cover everthing from the basics, example writing first txt file of hello worlds and why we need to convert it to json, typescript, react or event html/htm etc.

Steps - 
1. Create a simple basic HTML page with Header, Title, Body 
2. Create a simple HTML button and add inline Javascrtipt on the click event
3. Move this inline Javascript to a separate file and call on the HTML page
    1. My first mistake - I made the change but id didn't work, but somehoe the Utility.js file was not properly saved, Please make sure to save all your content, The file only shows the option if it's got modify but didn't show option for the modification 
4. How to pass value in the javasctipt funnction and do the operations
