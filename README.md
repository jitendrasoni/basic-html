# basics
Basic of all headless and mordern architecture
There are so man mordern frameworks for the front end technologies but the basic is always the same, in this project I wanted to make sure to cover everthing from the basics, example writing first txt file of hello worlds and why we need to convert it to json, typescript, react or event html/htm etc.
